# SPACE-MISSIONS-DASHBOARD

I am excited to share my latest project, the SPACE MISSIONS DASHBOARD, which I built using Power BI. This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of space missions with a focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) and interactive visualizations. Below is a detailed description of the features and functionalities of the dashboard:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Total Missions: The overall count of space missions.
Successful Missions: The number of missions that were completed successfully.
Failed Missions: The number of missions that ended in failure.
Partial Failure: Missions that did not fully achieve their objectives.
Prelaunch Failure: Missions that failed before launch.
Total Price: The cumulative cost of all missions.
Success Rate: The percentage of missions that were successful.
Slicers:
To enhance data interactivity and filtering, I included the following slicers:

Failure: Filter data to show only failed missions.
Partial Failure: Focus on missions with partial failure.
Prelaunch Failure: View data for missions that failed prelaunch.
Success: Filter to display successful missions only.
Visualizations:
Line Chart of Missions Over Years:

Displays the trend of space missions over different years, showing how the number of missions has evolved over time.
Scatter Chart of Missions by Location:

Plots the missions based on their launch locations, providing a geographical overview of where space missions originate.
Stacked Bar Charts:

Successful Missions by Company: Shows the distribution of successful missions across different space companies.
Total Missions by Rocket: Illustrates the number of missions conducted by various rockets.
Donut Chart of Total Missions by Mission Status:

Visualizes the proportion of missions by their status (e.g., successful, failed, partial failure, prelaunch failure).
Additional Information:
This dashboard not only provides insights into the performance and outcomes of space missions but also allows for interactive data exploration through slicers. It is designed to help analysts and enthusiasts understand the complexities and achievements in the field of space exploration.
